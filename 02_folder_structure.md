Here's a description of each folder and the key files within them:
* `assets/`: This directory is for static assets like images, fonts, and styles. You can organize your assets into subdirectories as needed.
* `images/`: Store images used in your project.
* `styles/`: Store global CSS or SASS/SCSS files.
* `components/`: Vue components go in this folder. Each component should have its own `.vue` file.
* `views/`: This folder is for Vue components that represent different views or pages of your application. Each view should correspond to a different route in your application.
* `router/`: If you're using Vue Router for routing, you can place your routing configuration in this folder. The `index.js` file is the main router configuration.
* `store/`: If you're using Vuex for state management, you can organize your store modules and configuration in this folder. The `index.js` file is the main store configuration.
* `plugins/`: Store any Vue plugins and configurations here. For example, if you're using Vuetify, you can place the Vuetify configuration in a file like `vuetify.js`
* `utils/`: This directory is for utility functions, API calls, or helper scripts that you use throughout your application.
* `App.vue`: The root Vue component of your application, which contains the main application structure and layout.
* `main.js`: This is the entry point for your Vue application. It initializes your Vue app, sets up global configurations, and mounts the root component.

This structure is organized to promote modularity, making it easier to manage and scale your Vue 3 application. Depending on the size and complexity of your project, you can add more directories or further organize your code to suit your specific needs.
